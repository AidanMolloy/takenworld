This is not a file on takenworld just for github!

You can find this website on www.takenworld.com
The website was built for google chrome mainly it works but hasnt been fully tested on firefox
and internet explorer isn't working so far at the moment I am focusing on those problems.

The website doesnt work either on smaller screens but works on any screen that has browser window width of 1366.
